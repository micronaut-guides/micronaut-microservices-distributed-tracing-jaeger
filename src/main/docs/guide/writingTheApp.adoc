The initial folder contains a sample application. To learn more about this sample app read
http://guides.micronaut.io/micronaut-microservices-services-discover-consul/guide/index.html[Consul and Micronaut - Microservices service discovery
] guide. The application contains three microservices.

* `bookcatalogue` - It returns a list of books. It uses a domain consisting of a book name and isbn.

* `bookinventory` - It exposes an endpoint to check whether a book has sufficient stock to fullfil an order.  It uses a domain consisting of a stock level and isbn.

* `bookrecommendation` - It consumes previous services and exposes and endpoint which recommends book names which are in stock.

The `bookcatalogue` service consumes endpoints exposed by the other services. The following image illustrates the application flow:

A request to `bookrecommendation` (`http://localhost:8080/books`) triggers several requests through our microservices mesh.
